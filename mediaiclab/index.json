It is fundamentally challenging because differences between vehicles are sometimes subtle. While several studies incorporate spatial-attention mechanisms to help vehicle re-ID, they often require expensive keypoint labels or suffer from noisy attention mask if not trained with expensive labels. In this work, we propose a dedicated Semantics-guided Part Attention Network (SPAN) to robustly predict part attention masks for different views of vehicles given only image-level semantic labels during training. With the help of part attention masks, we can extract discriminative features in each part separately. Then we introduce Co-occurrence Part-attentive Distance Metric (CPDM) which places greater emphasis on co-occurrence vehicle parts when evaluating the feature distance of two images. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","tags":["Vehicle Re-Identification","visibility-aware features","semantic-guided learning"],"title":"Orientation-aware Vehicle Re-identification with Semantics-guided Part Attention Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu-Cheng Wu","**Chih-Ting Liu**","Bo-Ying Chen","Shao-Yi Chien"],"categories":["Pruning"],"content":"","date":1592006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592006400,"objectID":"b770d703ad7b5bdbf3417440ab303961","permalink":"http://media.ee.ntu.edu.tw/personal/jackieliu/publication/cvprw20_caie/","publishdate":"2020-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/personal/jackieliu/publication/cvprw20_caie/","section":"publication","summary":"Filter pruning is an efficient way to structurally remove the redundant parameters in convolutional neural network, where at the same time reduces the computation, memory storage and transfer cost. Recent state-of-the-art methods globally estimate the importance of each filter based on its impact to the loss and iteratively remove those with smaller values until the pruned network meets some resource constraints, such as the commonly used number (or ratio) of filter left. However, when there is a more practical constraint like the total number of FLOPs, they ignore its relation to the estimation of filter importance. We propose a novel method called Constraint-Aware Importance Estimation (CAIE) that integrates information of the impact on the given resource into the original importance estimation only based on loss when pruning each filter. Moreover, our CAIE can be generalized to the pruning problem under multiple resource constraints simultaneously. Extensive experiments show that under the same multiple resource constraints, the model pruned with our CAIE method can not only accurately meet the constraints but also achieve the optimal performance results when comparing to existing state-of-the-art methods.","tags":["Importance Estimation","Multiple Resource Constriants","Filter Pruning"],"title":"Constraint-Aware Importance Estimation for Global Filter Pruning Under Multiple Resource Constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Chih-Ting Liu**","Chih-Wei Wu","[Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=24037)","Shao-Yi Chien"],"categories":["Re-ID"],"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"fb3ab0705524c507f0a545c6b98fa2ae","permalink":"http://media.ee.ntu.edu.tw/personal/jackieliu/publication/bmvc19_stenvan/","publishdate":"2020-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/personal/jackieliu/publication/bmvc19_stenvan/","section":"publication","summary":"Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching video sequences of pedestrians across non-overlapping cameras. It is a practical yet challenging task of how to embed spatial and temporal information of a video into its feature representation. While most existing methods learn the video characteristics by aggregating image-wise features and designing attention mechanisms in Neural Networks, they only explore the correlation between frames at high-level features. In this work, we target at refining the intermediate features as well as high-level features with non-local attention operations and make two contributions.(i) We propose a Non-local Video Attention Network (NVAN) to incorporate video characteristics into the representation at multiple feature levels.(ii) We further introduce a Spatially and Temporally Efficient Non-local Video Attention Network (STE-NVAN) to reduce the computation complexity by exploring spatial and temporal redundancy presented in pedestrian videos. Extensive experiments show that our NVAN outperforms state-of-the-arts by 3.8% in rank-1 accuracy on MARS dataset and confirms our STE-NVAN displays a much superior computation footprint compared to existing methods.","tags":["Video-based Re-Identification","Non-local Attention","Performance-Computation Trade-off"],"title":"Spatially and Temporally Efficient Non-local Attention Network for Video-based Person Re-Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Chih-Ting Liu**","Man-Yu Lee","Chih-Wei Wu","Bo-Ying Chen","Tsai-Shien Chen","Yao-Ting Hsu","Shao-Yi Chien"],"categories":["Re-ID"],"content":"","date":1560988800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560988800,"objectID":"95e6804b54a20c97445845379dcfb0cd","permalink":"http://media.ee.ntu.edu.tw/personal/jackieliu/publication/cvprw19_jdrn/","publishdate":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/personal/jackieliu/publication/cvprw19_jdrn/","section":"publication","summary":"in conjunction with 2019 NVIDIA AI City Challenge","tags":["Vehicle Re-Identification","Joint Domain Learning"],"title":"Supervised Joint Domain Learning for Vehicle Re-Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Chih-Ting Liu**","Tung-Wei Lin","Yi-Heng Wu","Yu-Sheng Lin","Heng Lee","Yu Tsao","Shao-Yi Chien"],"categories":["Pruning"],"content":"","date":1545868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545868800,"objectID":"e7c3ee3b4957cefcd072db2f78299ebd","permalink":"http://media.ee.ntu.edu.tw/personal/jackieliu/publication/tcas18_cpo/","publishdate":"2020-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/personal/jackieliu/publication/tcas18_cpo/","section":"publication","summary":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely employed in modern computer vision algorithms, where the input image is convolved iteratively by many filters to extract the knowledge behind it.

To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, CPO is applied to the networks for image super-resolution and image classification.
